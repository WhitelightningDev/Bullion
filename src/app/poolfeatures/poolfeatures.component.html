            Work</h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            Member's funds are used to buy units in pools selected by the member. The pools are invested in precious
            metals (95% or more) and cash or other instruments depending on the type of pool. Gold and silver stock
            consist of Krugerrands (1Oz and 1/10 Oz Gold Krugers and 1 Oz Silver Krugers) which are very liquid and
            acceptable worldwide. Gold Krugerrands do not attract VAT.
