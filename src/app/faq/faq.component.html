          <p>Gold, Silver, or Platinum pools (i.e. the unit prices) are valued at the daily wholesale price
             (which is priced around a 5% premium over the London PM Fix). A member buys in and sells at this price.
             The admin fee and commission are added when buying in.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Buying elsewhere may cost 10% or more over the London PM Fix. Selling may yield less.</li>
            <li>The unitized system ensures members rarely sell for less than wholesale (London PM Fix +5%).</li>
            <li>Trade cost is reduced to ~0.15%, significantly lower than competitors.</li>
            <li>Bullion offers full transparency and low pricing for members.</li>
            <li>Traditional unit trusts cannot hold physical precious metals due to FAIS restrictions. Bullion fills that gap.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Redemption:</strong> Members can redeem units for cash, gold, silver, platinum â€” or any combination.</p>
