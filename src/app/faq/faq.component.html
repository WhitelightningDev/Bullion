            Gold, Silver, or Platinum pools (i.e. the unit prices) are valued at the daily wholesale price
            (which is priced around a 5% premium over the London PM Fix). A member buys in and sells at this price.
            The admin fee and commission are added when buying in.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buying elsewhere may cost 10% or more over the London PM Fix. Selling may yield less.</li>
            <li>The unitized system ensures members rarely sell for less than wholesale (London PM Fix +5%).</li>
            <li>Trade cost is reduced to ~0.15%, significantly lower than competitors.</li>
            <li>Bullion offers full transparency and low pricing for members.</li>
            <li>Traditional unit trusts cannot hold physical precious metals due to FAIS restrictions. Bullion fills
              that gap.</li>

          <p>
            This is a very secure business vehicle for holding a member's precious metal assets.
            The Co-operative has the right of possession, while members share ownership of the pools according
            to the number of units allocated to them. Therefore, creditors of the co-operative, if any, are not
            entitled to lay claim to any precious metals or cash that is being held on behalf of the members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Co-operative has no creditors apart from the bank for bank charges and the auditors.
            Its only liability is to the members for their units.

            <li>Reduces entry/exit costs from over 5% to as low as ~0.15% per trade.</li>
            <li>Accommodates round amounts without precise metal pricing (e.g. R100,000).</li>
            <li>Allows smaller investments (e.g. R500 debit order) that still gain exposure to metals.</li>
            <li>Enables flexible cash withdrawals (e.g. redeem R4,500 from R545,678.98 value).</li>
            <li>Insurance, admin, and safekeeping costs are paid by the pool, not the member.</li>

          <p>

            Unitizing is a method used to as accurately as possible keep record of each investor's equitable share in a
            pool of assets.
            It ensures that a new investor's share is based on the price he joins the pool and investors in that pool
            share pro-rata
            in the costs of that pool.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pool X starts at <strong>R1.00 per unit</strong>.</li>
            <li>Investor A invests <strong>R100,000</strong>, receiving <strong>100,000 units</strong> at R1.00 each.
            </li>
            <li>The pool uses <strong>R99,000</strong> to purchase <strong>11 Krugerrands at R9,000</strong> each.</li>
            <li>Remaining <strong>cash = R1,000</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Krugerrands are priced at <strong>R9,200</strong>.</li>
            <li>Krugerrands value: <strong>11 x R9,200 = R101,200</strong></li>
            <li>Cash: <strong>R1,000</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Total Pool Value = R102,200</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Unit Price = R102,200 / 100,000 = R1.022 per unit</strong></li>
            <li>Investor A's holding = <strong>100,000 x R1.022 = R102,200</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Mr Z invests R100,000 on Day 2</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>He receives <strong>R100,000 / R1.022 = 97,847.36 units</strong></li>
            <li>Total units in pool = <strong>197,847.36 units</strong></li>
            <li>The pool buys <strong>10 Krugerrands at R9,200 = R92,000</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Pool Composition Now:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Krugerrands: <strong>21 x R9,200 = R193,200</strong></li>
            <li>Cash: <strong>R9,000</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Total Pool Value = R202,200</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Unit Price = R202,200 / 197,847.36 = R1.022</strong></li>

              <strong>Monthly cost deductions:</strong><br>
              Costs for insurance, vaults, and administration are deducted from the pool once a month or as they occur.
              This effectively results in a member "selling" a small portion of their metals. Members may make
              ad-hoc contributions to cover these costs out of pocket to preserve their metal share.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              <strong>Cash reserve effect:</strong><br>
              When the pool is not fully invested in precious metals and holds a portion in cash, fluctuations in metal
              prices
              will cause the unit price to change at a slower rate than the actual price of the metals.
              This may result in a slight positive or negative shift in the metal composition. The co-op generally aims
              to maintain <strong>3% to 10% of the pool in cash</strong> for operational flexibility.

          <p><strong>Income Tax:</strong><br>
            None. Since no interest is earned, income tax is not applicable — either on the member’s holdings or
            membership fees.</p>

          <p><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT):</strong><br>
            No CGT is triggered when a member withdraws their member's interest in the form of physical gold, silver, or
            platinum.
            However, should the member sell the precious metals thereafter or redeem units for cash, CGT may apply and
            the member will be responsible for reporting such gains or losses to SARS.</p>

          <p>Profits or losses realized through trading pool redemptions will also be subject to CGT in the hands of the
            member.
            Bullion itself carries no CGT liability.</p>

          <p><strong>Value Added Tax (VAT):</strong><br>
            No VAT applies to Krugerrands.<br>
            VAT does apply to silver and platinum. As a VAT-registered entity, Bullion may reclaim INPUT VAT on
            purchases of silver and platinum.
            These VAT refunds may then be used to reinvest in more precious metals on behalf of the members.</p>
