      <h1 class="text-white fs-2">A Smarter Way to <strong class="text-warning">Grow & Secure Wealth</strong></h1>
      <p class="text-white fs-6">Member funds are unitized in separate pools, similar to unit trusts, and are closed on an annual basis. Units are bought or redeemed at the daily price, with 95â€“99% of each pool invested in hard metals.</p>
      <p class="text-white fs-6">Pools are managed by the Co-op but owned by members via units. Members may redeem units for cash, metals, or both at year-end, or as decided by the Board.</p>
      <p class="text-white fs-6">Membership is required to invest in any pool. All data and holdings are kept strictly confidential.</p>
      <p class="text-white fs-6">Member login provides access to personal data and investment values.</p>
