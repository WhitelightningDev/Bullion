      <p class="text-white">
        Member's funds are unitized in separate pools that work in a similar way as unit trusts and are closed on an annual basis.
        The pools are valued regularly and funds flowing in or out will buy or redeem units at the unit price of the day.
        The precious metal pools are 95% to 99% invested in hard metals. Members are free to decide how deposits are to be allocated in the available pools.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white">
        The pools are managed and controlled by the Co-op but owned by members via units. Deposits are allowed in a pool until the Board decides when it is closed.
        A member may redeem his units for cash or for precious metals in the pool or a combination thereof at the end of the calendar period/year,
        or shorter or extended period as the Board may decide.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white">
        To invest in any available pool, it is necessary to be a member of Bullion Co-operative Limited.
